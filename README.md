This project utilizes ReactJS to provide a visual representation of the local search algorithm that solves the 8 Queens problem. The 8 Queens problem is a classic puzzle that involves placing eight chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard in a way that none of the queens threaten each other.

The local search algorithm is a heuristic algorithm that initiates with a random initial state and gradually improves it by making small changes to the present state in such a way that the new state has less cost than the current state. This process is repeated until it finds the optimal solution. ReactJS is an efficient and powerful framework that is commonly used for developing interactive user interfaces, making it an ideal choice for visualising the 8 Queens problem solution process.
